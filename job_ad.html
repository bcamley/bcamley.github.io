<h2 class = "cap"><center>Join the group!</center></h2><br><br>

<p>Potential graduate students should apply to either the <a href = "http://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/graduate/admissions/">Physics & Astronomy Graduate Program</a> or one of the <a href = "http://biophysics.jhu.edu/graduate/">Biophysics Graduate Programs</a> at JHU, depending on what your background and interests best fit. If you are interested in working in the group, you are also welcome to contact Brian directly.</p>

<p>Undergraduates who are interested in working in the group should email Brian directly.</p>

<!--<p>We are looking for one or more postdoctoral scholars to work on physics of cell biology using theory and computation with Prof. Brian Camley at Johns Hopkins University. Broad questions of interest include:
<ul>
<li>When can we scale up from understanding cell-cell collisions to predict collective properties of a tissue?
<li>How does a cell's ability to respond to contact cues depend on its shape - how can cells respond reliably to tiny contact cues?
<li>How does mechanical force on cell-cell junctions lead to changes in the underlying polarity of the cell?
</ul></p>

<p>In particular, we have dedicated funding to support a postdoc for a collaboration on cell motility and cell-cell interactions on nanofibers between the Camley group at JHU and the <a href = "https://www.step-lab-vt.com/">Nain group at Virginia Tech</a>. (See <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2011815118">our recent collaborative paper</a> and <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005239">related earlier work</a>). Questions could include understanding how cells adhere to fibers, how cell geometry alters Rho GTPase dynamics, and developing data-driven models to predict outcomes of cell-cell collisions.</p>

<p>We do have some flexibility in projects and funding, and candidates who have additional ideas for projects in line with the group's expertise are encouraged to mention them in their letter!</p>

<p>This position will be for one year, renewable for up to three years. To apply, please send a letter of interest, CV, and contact information for references (preferably at least three) to bcamley at gmail dot com. <b>Start date is flexible!</b></p> 

<p>Who would do well in this job? We use tools from soft matter and statistical physics, so Physics PhDs are a natural fit but many other PhDs (Math, Engineering, etc.) may be appropriate. Fluency in computational methods is required; prior experience in biological systems is nice but not necessary. </p>-->

<!--<p>These aren't required, but in your letter, you should mention if you have experience with any of these fields/techniques: </p>
<ul>
<li> Numerical solution of PDEs
<li> Phase field methods
<li> General-purpose GPU computation
<li> Active matter
<li> Developing or improving molecular dynamics methods
<li> Stochastic methods (Langevin dynamics, Master equations, Gillespie, Monte Carlo etc.)
<li> Bayesian inference (especially including MCMC methods)
<li> Estimation theory, statistical signal processing, information theory, etc.
<li> Rheology and dynamics of viscoelastic materials
<li> Low Reynolds number hydrodynamics
<li> Systems biology and modeling signaling networks
</ul>
