<h2 class = "cap"><center>Join the group!</center></h2><br><br>

<p>Potential graduate students should apply to either the <a href = "http://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/graduate/admissions/">Physics & Astronomy Graduate Program</a> or one of the <a href = "http://biophysics.jhu.edu/graduate/">Biophysics Graduate Programs</a> at JHU, depending on what your background and interests best fit. If you are interested in working in the group, you are also welcome to contact Brian directly.</p>

<p>Undergraduates who are interested in working in the group should email Brian directly.</p>

<p>We are looking for a postdoctoral scholar to work on physics of cell biology using theory and computation. This postdoc's research could be on one of several broad questions including:</p>
<ol>
	<li> What are the fundamental physical and information-based limits that control the ability of cells to cooperate and make decisions?
	<li> How do mechanical forces between cells organize collective behavior in a tissue?
	<li> How can we best extract useful information describing cell motility from experimental trajectories of cell motion?
	<li> How can nanometer-scale proteins sense micron-scale shape features in cells?
</ol>
<p>Postdocs who have additional ideas for projects in line with the group's expertise are encouraged to mention them!</p>

<p>This position will be for one year, renewable for up to three years. To apply, please send a letter of interest, CV, and contact information for references (preferably at least three) to bcamley at gmail dot com. <b>Start date is flexible, but October 2019 would be ideal.</b></p> 

<p>Who would do well in this job? Like everyone else, we are looking for a highly motivated postdoc with strong communication skills. We use tools from soft matter and statistical physics, so Physics PhDs are a natural fit but many other PhDs (Math, Engineering, etc.) may be appropriate. Fluency in computational methods is required; prior experience in biological systems is nice but not necessary. </p>

<!--<p>These aren't required, but in your letter, you should mention if you have experience with any of these fields/techniques: </p>
<ul>
<li> Numerical solution of PDEs
<li> Phase field methods
<li> General-purpose GPU computation
<li> Active matter
<li> Developing or improving molecular dynamics methods
<li> Stochastic methods (Langevin dynamics, Master equations, Gillespie, Monte Carlo etc.)
<li> Bayesian inference (especially including MCMC methods)
<li> Estimation theory, statistical signal processing, information theory, etc.
<li> Rheology and dynamics of viscoelastic materials
<li> Low Reynolds number hydrodynamics
<li> Systems biology and modeling signaling networks
</ul>
