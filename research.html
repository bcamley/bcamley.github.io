We are interested in many questions related to this process, which requires the cells to integrate noisy signals in a complex way. We recently found that, because each cell is distinct, these clumps are biased toward cells that are "loud" - sending inappropriately large signals. Cell clusters can reduce this bias by rearranging themselves so loud cells change their locations (<b>video at left</b>). This means the <i>mechanical</i> dynamics of the cluster matter - fluid, squishy clumps of cells with smaller relaxation time &tau;<sub>r</sub> are better at sensing than solid ones.

    <h3 class = "cap"> How can fluid mechanics control membrane protein dynamics? </h3><p>We study the role of fluid mechanics in many cell-biological processes, but have a soft spot for the lipid membrane. One classical model of the lipid bilayer membrane is to describe it as a two-dimensional fluid -- surrounded by water on either side. Many predictions of this <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffman-Delbruck_model">"Saffman-Delbruck"</a> model have been verified in experiments and in molecular dynamics simulations, but can have striking counter-intuitive consequences -- predicting that even proteins with orders of magnitude different sizes have very similar diffusion coefficients. We recently found another surprise.  In a finite system, like a simulation with periodic boundaries, errors can sometimes get <i>larger</i> when you make the system size larger. See papers: <a href = "http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4932980">[Camley et al. 2015]</a>,<a href = "http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b09111">[Venable et al. 2017]</a> and the online web interface for estimating these correction effects <a href = "https://diffusion.lobos.nih.gov">diffusion.lobos.nih.gov</a></td>

    <h3 class = "cap"> How does a cell's shape interact with its internal biochemistry? </h3><p> Cell biology creates a lot of interesting questions where diffusion occurs on a deforming object, which can lead to a lot of surprises!  The direction a cell crawls is set by proteins that control the polymerization machinery at the cell front. In a commonly-used model of these "polarity proteins," the cell front will move toward the narrow end of the cell -- if the cell's shape stays constant. However, because the shape changes in response to these proteins, new behaviors show up - including cells that travel in circles.
